    <h2>DNA Sequencer Project Overview</h2>
    <p>
    A key element in many bioinformatics problems is the biological sequence. 
    A biological sequence is just a list of characters chosen from some alphabet. 
    Two of the common biological sequences are DNA (composed of the four characters A, C, G, and T) 
    and RNA (composed of the four characters A, C, G, and U). 
    
    The Sequencer project, implements some basic functionality for manipulating 
    DNA and RNA sequence fragments.
    </p>

    <h2>Implementation</h2>
    <p> 
    You will implement sequence fragments using linked lists, storing one letter of the 
    sequence per linked list node. 
    The list classes used in this project manage sequences using a singly linked list.
    </p>
    <p> 
    In addition to the linked lists of sequences, the project maintains a "fragment list" 
    which stores the various sequences. 
    Commands that manipulate sequences will refer directly to entries in the fragment list. 
    The fragment list stores the linked list that stores the sequence itself and the 
    sequence which stores the sequence characters also stores the sequence type (RNA or DNA).
    The sequence type field uses an enumerated type, and one enumeration
    value is used to recognize that a particular sequence is empty.
    </p>

    <p> All indexing (both for the fragment list and for positions in a sequence) begin with position one.
    </p>
    <p> 
    The primary design consideration for this project will be the interface between 
    the list class and its client. 
    It is mandatory that the list class remains application independent. 
    No bioinformatics-related code should be part of the list class.
    </p>
    <h2>Running the program</h2>
    <p>The program is invoked from the command-line as:
    <pre>
     java cisc187.dna.{@link cisc187.dna.Sequencer} [size] [file] </pre>
    <dl> Where:
      <dt> <tt>sequencer</tt></dt>
      <dd>is the program name</dd>
      <dt> <tt>size</tt></dt>
      <dd>is the size of the fragment list</dd>
      <dt> <tt>file</tt></dt>
      <dd>is the name of a file containing program commands.  </dd>
    </dl>
    Class {@link cisc187.dna.FragmentList} has details on the commands available.
    </p>
    <p>The anr run target runs the equvalent of:
    <pre>
     java cisc187.dna.Sequencer 8 commands.txt </pre>
